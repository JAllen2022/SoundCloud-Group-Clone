To-Do:
media queries
all seeds should be seeded in seed file (once jason uploads songs and images to aws)
make feed/home page
continuous play
add readme gifs


Hard to do:
users likes in chronological Order
when uploading song, preview image is automatically the img from file


At Some Point Maybe:
search bar
nested comments

waveform stuff:
store waveforms in database on song upload



Next:
jason and ryan - waveforms

Done:
style the player
render waveforms for each song item
pause button on song page smaller
Jason - sync waveform with audio player
image on edit form should be the songs current image
cancel button on edit song does not work
fix comment name and created at color
song description displayed somewhere
song upload time is wrong
song upload time is scrunched
404 page when navigating to non-existent user/song/etc.
user profile button when a display name is too long
readme
remove console.logs
CRON job: ping
